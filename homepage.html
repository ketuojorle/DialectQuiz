                                                 Consequent upon the drastic decline in the use of Ebu dialect by the current generation of Ebu parents in 
                                                the up bringing of their wards, i deem it very imperative to develop this platform aimed at tutoring kids of Ebu
                                                origin as well as none-indigenes who are interested. This is to avoid the 
                                                 dialect going into oblivion. Moreover, to know more about the Ebu people in Delta State of Nigeria.

                                          <p>There is this wrong notion by most parents that children that speak their local dialects are academically backward.
                                             When i was with Yale Foods Limited in Ibadan, Nigeria. The chinese engineer that came for the installation of a newly 
                                             acquired biscuit packaging machines couldn't communicate in english. It was an interpreter that was employed for 
                                             communication with his fellow Nigerian engineers. He could read the machine softwares coded in chinese and 
                                             got the job done within the shortest time. So intelligence is not really a function of one's ability to speak 
                                             english language only. Therefore, speaking of local dialects should be encouraged. Seems you are guilty of this? You need not,
                                             You can start learning or teaching your kids and wards today.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>Moreover, If not for anything securitywise your dialect will be useful to you someday. Even if you live in a country with advanced 
                                              security infrastructure which i in doubt if there is any with the current pace of global spread of insecurity. The proactiveness 
                                              of the security systems of these advanced countries are beign preempted. Security alerts could be shared in local dialects 
                                              among family members and this could help avert disaster.<br>A very good example was the 
                                              <a JavaScript:void(0) href ="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/3/biden-raid-in-syria-has-taken-isis-leader-off-the-battlefield " ; target="_blank" >
                                               killing of ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Qurayshi by the US Special forces</a> on the 2nd of February, 2022 in a counterterrorism 
                                               mission in North-west Syria. Thirteen casualties was recorded during and after the raid. This includes six children and four women. This low figure was recorded definitely because
                                               when the American forces landed with the attack helicopters, the services of a local was employed. The local communicated in arabic to occupants in the building and surroundings
                                               to quickly vacate to a designated safer place because they were not aware that a terrorists leader dwells among them. Alot of them left the environ while the affected
                                               wasn't lucky enough because the terrorist went suicidal by detonating the bomb in his jacket to avoid beign captured alive. Don't you think the casualties figure would have 
                                               been more if not for the timely communication in  the local dialect? I guess your answer will definitely be "YES" as mine.
